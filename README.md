# My First Experience With Coding:

After watching an online tutorial on an HTML/CSS course for beginners from YouTube by [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) taught by Per Borgen of [Scrimba,](https://scrimba.com/) I was able to create this project. As a beginner, I recognize that I have a long way to go, but I'm excited about my progress.

Happy Coding!
